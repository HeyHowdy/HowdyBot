# HowdyBot
*This is my first attempt at a Discord.js bot, things might be a little messy but they work and can be improved upon. I will often update the bot with new features but it's idealy just a boilerplate for anyone wishing to use it and for myself with future projects.*

## Features
- Command/Event handler with sub folders.
- Data saving to JSON files.
- XP/Level system that's easily configurable.
- Currency system which also has features with the XP system & comes with betting.
- Basic commands (level, hcoin, clear, whois, bet, give, meme, & reload).
- A decent base to start out with.
- Trivia system that calls every 24 minutes, guessing correctly rewards you with hcoin.

###### Requirements
**You must have Node installed on your computer to begin developing with this bot, as with any Discord.js project. Install it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/)**

###### TODO
- [ ] More moderation commands such as kick, ban, and temporary alternatives.
- [ ] Storing data to a NoSQL database rather than JSON files.
- [ ] Support for multi-server use.
- [ ] Web interface for server settings

###### Suggestions
Im open to any suggestions for the bot, feel free to message me on Discord with any suggestions you may have: Howdy#1337
